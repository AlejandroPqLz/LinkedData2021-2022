        <h1>Analysis </h1>
        <h4>License of the new dataset </h4>
        <p>Following with the requisites that are stated on the license of the Madrid's City Hall, we can put any license as long as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>It is prohibited to desnaturilize the sense of the information</li>
                <li>It should be cited where the dataset was extracted from as "Origin of the data:  Madrid's City Hall"</li>
                <li>Include last modification date</li>
                <li>It may not be indicated, implied or suggested that the Madrid City Council participates, sponsors or supports the reuse that is carried out with the information.</li>
            </ul> 
        <p>So we decided to choose a Copyleft License including all the previous mentioned bullet points.  </p> 
        <p>In conlusion, the user of our dataset has the same liberties as we have when using the Madrid's City Hall dataset.  </p>    
        <h4>Resource naming strategy</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Uses a domain that is not the one given by default in Protégé</li>
            <li>Uses different paths for ontology resources (i.e., classes and properties) and individuals</li>
            <li>Ensures that the paths for individuals of different classes are not the same </li>
            <li>Defines individual URIs independently of class URIs</li>
        </ul>
