<h1>License analysis</h1>


<p>Both datasets belong to the Madrid data portal, so the publisher is the city council of Madrid.
However, the rihgtsholder is Dirección General de Sostenibilidad y Control Ambiental, to which the responsibility for the dataset is attributed.


<p>The data we are going to use for our project has a CC BY 4.0 license, with some additional modification as the following ones:
<p> -> The date of the last update must be mentioned.
<p> -> It may not be indicated, insinuated or suggested that the Community of Madrid and the Madrid City Council participate on the proyect where the data will be used.
<p> -> No re-identification of persons process are allowed.

<p>Therefore, we can conclude that our data are under a CC BY 4.0 license with some extra use conditions.

<p>Lastly, after a consensus with the whole group, we have decided that, when we publish our data, we will do it under a CC BY 4.0 license so that anyone who need it can get access to them without problems, regardless of their purpose.


<h1>Resource naming strategy</h1>

<p>Firstly, we define the class 'Madrid' which will be the one that we will link with other ontologies. This class has an object property(hasControlStation) that connect it with the class 'ControlStation'.
<p>Secondly, we define two more classes, 'ControlStation' and 'Measurement', each one with their own data properties and objects properties.
<p>The class 'ControlStation' has two object properties (isIn, hasMeasurement) that connect this class with other clases.
<p>The other class we have define is 'Measurement', which only have one object property (isFrom) that connect this class with the class 'ControlStation'. Nevertheless, this class has many data properties with their corresponding range restrictions:
<p>atYear:          xsd:nonNegativeInteger
<p>hasValue:        xsd:float >= 0
<p>atHour:          xsd:int between 1 and 24
<p>atDate:          xsd:dateTime
<p>atDay:           xsd:int between 1 and 31
<p>hasMagnitude:    xsd:string  *For example, in this field we can include diferent data for each measure like: Wind velocity(m/s), SO_2 (μg/m^3)...
